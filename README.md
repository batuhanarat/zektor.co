# Zektor

Zektor is an AI-based solution for Vertical Farming that aims to reduce labor requirements while increasing operational efficiency. Our system optimizes farming processes through  automation and data-driven decision making by providing comprehensive insights about facilities through health and development phase analysis of plants. This analysis helps farmers monitor plant health in real-time and make informed decisions about their crops' development stages, enabling more precise and efficient farming operations.
